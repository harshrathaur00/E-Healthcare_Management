# E-Healthcare_Management
Project for creating e healthcare management system.

The e-Healthcare management system is a web-based project that seeks to provide effective management of employee data and medical
data of patients in hospitals and clinics. Data mining techniques lie at the core of this project, which consists of 2 modules: an administration
module and a client module. While the administration module is concerned with Medicare Management that includes healthcare
departments, doctors, nurses, ward, and clerks, the client module is for patients. In many ways business intelligence is revolutionizing
healthcare.
The key features of the e-Healthcare management system are:
* It establishes a clear line of contact and communication between doctors and patients.
* It accurately analyses usage percentage of the hospital resources, including laboratory equipment, bed occupation ratio, administration, medicines, etc.
* It leverages the CRISP-DM (standard cross-industry process for data mining) creating an accurate and effective management system.Hospital Management System project in Java Mysql Part 1

* It eliminates the problems of missing data and incorrect data.

Through these features, the e-Healthcare management system will help overcome the drawbacks and challenges of the existing
healthcare management system. It will allow for the smooth management of hospital staff and quicken the process of delivery of healthcare services.
